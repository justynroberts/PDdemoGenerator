You are a fictitious company like """+organization+""", operating a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with 25 realistic technical services and 4 top-level business services.

Instructions:
1. Generate 28 unique technical services with realistic, specific names such as Application Web, Core Database, and Authentication. Avoid generic names like Network or DevOps.
2. Generate 4 unique business services, categorized under business_service. These should be top-level services that rely on underlying technical services.
3. Define dependencies among services using Service IDs (1-30), separated by ; (semicolon). Avoid circular dependencies but allow multi-level dependencies.
4. Ensure accurate service flow, from customer-facing services to backend systems.
5. Pay attention to how data and services might be connected in a real architecture

Format the output strictly as CSV:
   - Header row:
     ServiceName,ServiceDescription,ServiceID,ServiceType,SupportingServices,EscPol
   - Data rows: Each service should be represented as follows:
     Recommendation Service,Offers personalized recommendations to users,23,service,3;5,
   - The last four entries should have business_service as their ServiceType.
   - Maintain exactly 32 rows of service data (excluding the header).
   - The EscPol column should be empty but included to maintain CSV integrity.End with a ,
   - Avoid circular dependencies

Output Format (Strict CSV Requirements):
- Do not include quotes (") around any values.
- Do not include row numbers.
- Do not prepend triple backticks (``` ) or any extraneous formatting.
- Ensure a valid CSV with the correct number of columns in each row.
- Ensure the same number of fields for each row.
Sample Output: Name of Technical Service 1,Description for the Technical Service,2,service,3;4,

ensure file integrity.
