# üåü Service Graph Generator

This tool generates PagerDuty sample service graphs from CSV files using Terraform, based on a "similar company" to any organization.
Based on original code by James Pickles (https://github.com/pdt-jpickles), enhanced to include a Python service architecture generator with OpenAI.

## üéØ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Terraform (>= 0.13.0)
- PagerDuty account with admin access
- PagerDuty API token
- OpenAI API token

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Generate a PagerDuty API token:
   - Go to PagerDuty ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí API Access
   - Create a new API key with full access
   - Save the token securely

4. Generate a OpenAI API token:
   - Create a new API key with 
   - Save in the generator.py 

## üî® Usage

### 1. Generate Service Architecture ü§ñ

To generate a new service architecture CSV:

1. Edit `generate.py` to set your copied organization name:
   (eg Netflix)
```python
organization = "your-org-name"
```

2. Run the generator:
```bash
python generate.py
```

This will create a CSV file in the `service_maps` directory, based on a imaginary architecture.

### 2. Deploy to PagerDuty ‚ö°

1. Copy your generated CSV from `service_maps` to the Terraform directory:
```bash
cp service_maps/your-org-name.csv terraform-servicegraph-main/include_in_build/
```

2. Initialize Terraform:
```bash
cd terraform-servicegraph-main
terraform init
```

3. Deploy the service graph:
```bash
terraform apply -parallelism=1 -var="PAGERDUTY_TOKEN=your-token-here"
```

Alternatively, set the token as an environment variable:
```bash
export TF_VAR_PAGERDUTY_TOKEN=your-token-here
terraform apply -parallelism=1
```

4. Review the proposed changes and type `yes` to proceed.

## üìö Understanding the CSV Structure

The Terraform code expects CSV files with the following columns:
- `ServiceName`: Name of your service
- `ServiceDescription`: Optional description
- `ServiceID`: Unique identifier within the CSV (used for dependencies)
- `ServiceType`: Either `business_service` or `service`
- `SupportingServices`: Semi-colon separated list of ServiceIDs (e.g., "1;2;3")
- `EscPol`: Optional escalation policy ID (leave blank for default)

Example:
```csv
ServiceName,ServiceDescription,ServiceID,ServiceType,SupportingServices,EscPol
Payment Gateway,Processes payments,1,service,2;3,
```

## üé® Using Existing Templates

Pre-made industry templates are available in `terraform-servicegraph-main/available_templates/`:
- üõçÔ∏è ecommerce_services.csv
- üçî uber_eats.csv
- üí≥ paypal.csv

To use a template:
```bash
cp terraform-servicegraph-main/available_templates/ecommerce_services.csv terraform-servicegraph-main/include_in_build/
```

## üßπ Clean Up

To remove all resources from PagerDuty:
```bash
terraform destroy -var="PAGERDUTY_TOKEN=your-token-here"
```
## üßπ Prompt.
In case of wanting to use this with your own LLM (or internal tools). I used this prompt. Replace organisation with your copy organisation:

```
You are a fictitious company like {{organization}}, operating a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with 25 realistic technical services and 4 top-level business services.

Instructions:
1. Generate 28 unique technical services with realistic, specific names such as Application Web, Core Database, and Authentication. Avoid generic names like Network or DevOps.
2. Generate 4 unique business services, categorized under business_service. These should be top-level services that rely on underlying technical services.
3. Define dependencies among services using Service IDs (1-30), separated by ; (semicolon). Avoid circular dependencies but allow multi-level dependencies.
4. Ensure accurate service flow, from customer-facing services to backend systems.
5. Pay attention to how data and services might be connected in a real architecture

Format the output strictly as CSV:
   - Header row:
     ServiceName,ServiceDescription,ServiceID,ServiceType,SupportingServices,EscPol
   - Data rows: Each service should be represented as follows:
     Recommendation Service,Offers personalized recommendations to users,23,service,3;5,
   - The last four entries should have business_service as their ServiceType.
   - Maintain exactly 32 rows of service data (excluding the header).
   - The EscPol column should be empty but included to maintain CSV integrity.End with a ,
   - Avoid circular dependencies

Output Format (Strict CSV Requirements):
- Do not include quotes (") around any values.
- Do not include row numbers.
- Do not prepend triple backticks (``` ) or any extraneous formatting.
- Ensure a valid CSV with the correct number of columns in each row.
- Ensure the same number of fields for each row.
Sample Output: Name of Technical Service 1,Description for the Technical Service,2,service,3;4,

ensure file integrity.
```




## üìù Important Notes

- The `-parallelism=1` flag prevents PagerDuty API rate limiting
- Multiple CSV files can be processed simultaneously from `include_in_build`
- The Terraform code will:
  - Create technical services with default Operations (EP) escalation policy
  - Create business services
  - Establish service dependencies based on the SupportingServices column
  - Set up users, schedules, and escalation policies
- Service dependencies are unidirectional and should not create circular references
